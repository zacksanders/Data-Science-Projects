# Data Science Projects
This is a repository of some example projects I've done. 

[coronavirus](coronavirus): Brief data analysis and curve fitting for Thailand's coronavirus cases. The project was meant to use data from all countries and be predictive, but was left unfinished.

[fastai tweet analysis](fastai_tweet_analysis): The ULMFiT method is used to predict the sentiment of Twitter comments, using Fastai built on PyTorch. 

[housing](housing): Prediction of California housing prices using linear regression.

[origami disk for hoolia](origami-disk-for-hoolia): A short script to find line segments of a disk for DNA origami.

[wages](wages): Prediction of wages using a random forest of logic trees.
