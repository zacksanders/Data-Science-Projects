# Data Science Projects
This is a repository of some example projects I've done.

[housing](housing): Prediction of California housing prices using linear regression.

[origami disk for hoolia](origami_disk_for_hoolia): A short script to find line segments of a disk for DNA origami.

[wages](wages): Prediction of wages using a random forest of logic trees.
